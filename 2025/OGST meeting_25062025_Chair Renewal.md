# OGST meeting 25/06/2025 Chair Renewal

## Participants

Brad de Young, Pierre Testor, Victor Turpin, Mariarita Caracciolo, Robert Todd, Filipa Carvalho, Callum Rollo, Louise Biddle, Peng Wang, Naomi Krauzig, Ali Aydogdu, Charitha Pattiaratchi, Pierre Cauchy, Elisabeth Remy.

## Discussed topic: Report of Task Teams (TT)

### Boundary Currents TT (Robert Todd)
- Need more observing along the coast US
- Climate change report -> cannot publish it for now

### Storms TT (Charitha Pattiaratchi) 
- transition to more inclusive TT including marine heatwaves and flooding 
- doubled budget
- further discussion with the TT to more forward

### Passive Acoustics TT (Pierre Cauchy)
- 20+ people in the TT
- visibility of the work -> International Quiet Ocean Experiment (IQOE)
- 1st mobile autonomous dataset (ABACUS)
- ocean sound EOV
- Systems best practices 
- Workshop organisation PAM glider community (Autumn 2025)
Including instrumentatiion: NOAA glider rodeo, data format and methods

### Polar regions TT (Naomi Krauzig)
- IUGC side event (June 2024) and online survey
- key topics and feedback for under-ice technological needs
- ANTSUBICE Workshop (Seul 4-6 November 2024)
- Mainly Antarctica (not a lot from Arctic)

### Data simulations TT (Ali Aydogdu)
- Paper: Glider observations in the Western Mediterranean Sea: their assimilation and impact assessment using four analysis ad forecasting systems
- EuroSea MEAP TT seminar

### Data management TT (Emma Gardner/Callum Rollo)
- Define phase/profile/sections etc. -> defining vocabulary
- OG format -> EGO/OG1 conversion
- Share glider resourses (GitHub) -> tools people need (es. format data file)

## Other discussed topics

### OG format

Awareness increase needed around the OG format that Corolis is delivering.
Pipeline to process data "delayed mode" (NOC, Filipa) and scientific discussion, which variables to bring in?

### Added value of OG in the GOOS 

Need of an attack plan to bring gliders closer to Argo. Leveraging what Argo is doing.
Proposition to centralise efforts of the coastal observations: OceanGliders + Aniboss + Fishing Vessels. Look at the overlapand merge datastreams and technologies.
They are similar networks (close to the coast, mobile, underwater) and they could be seen as a sort of "cluster". They provide T / S observations and O2 / Chla observations and complement Argo.

## New chair election & changes in the coordination

Robert Todd and Filipa Carvalho are the new OG chair elected (Brad de Young and Pierre Testor will help the transition for the next year).
Chair role: 
- networkig with other GOOS networks
- report to OCG/GOOS
- interact with technical coordinatos
Mariarita Caracciolo is taking the role of Victor Turpin as OG coordinator.

## Proposed for the future

- Set up a new Hadal TT (deep sea)
- Highlight the role of data management TT
- Refresh and define clear ToR for the future OG

### Announcement of the new IUGC

Charitha Pattiaratchi announced that Australia will host the next IUGC conference in November 2026 in Perth.
